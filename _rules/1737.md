title: Use `-ing` and `-ed` to express pre-events and post-events
severity: 3

For example, a close event that is raised before a window is closed would be called `Closing`, and one that is raised after the window is closed would be called `Closed`. Don't use `Before` or `After` prefixes or suffixes to indicate pre and post events.

Suppose you want to define events related to the deletion of an object. Avoid defining the `Deleting` and `Deleted` events as `BeginDelete` and `EndDelete`. Define those events as follows:

- `Deleting`: Occurs just before the object is getting deleted.
- `Delete`: Occurs when the object needs to be deleted by the event handler.
- `Deleted`: Occurs when the object is already deleted.
