title: Don't expose stateful objects through static members
severity: 2
---
A stateful object is an object that contains many properties and lots of behavior behind it. If you expose such an object through a static property or method of some other object, it will be very difficult to refactor or unit test a class that relies on such a stateful object. In general, introducing a construct like that is a great example of violating many of the guidelines of this chapter.

A classic example of this is the `HttpContext.Current` property, part of ASP.NET. Many see the `HttpContext` class as a source of a lot of ugly code.
