title: Use lambda expressions instead of anonymous methods
severity: 1
---
Lambda expressions provide a more elegant alternative for anonymous methods. So instead of:

	Customer customer = Array.Find(customers, delegate(Customer customer)
	{
		return customer.Name == "Tom";
	});

use a lambda expression:

	Customer customer = Array.Find(customers, customer => customer.Name == "Tom");

Or even better:

	var customer = customers.FirstOrDefault(customer => customer.Name == "Tom");
