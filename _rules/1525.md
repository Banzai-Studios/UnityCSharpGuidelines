title: Don't make explicit comparisons to `true` or `false`
severity: 1

It is usually bad style to compare a `bool`-type expression to `true` or `false`. For example:

	while (condition == false) // wrong; bad style
	while (condition != true) // also wrong
	while (((condition == true) == true) == true) // where do you stop?
	while (condition) // OK
