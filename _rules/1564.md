title: Avoid signatures that take a `bool` parameter
severity: 2
---
Consider the following method signature:

	public Customer CreateCustomer(bool platinumLevel)
	{
	}

On first sight this signature seems perfectly fine, but when calling this method you will lose this purpose completely:

	Customer customer = CreateCustomer(true);

Often, a method taking such a bool is doing more than one thing and needs to be refactored into two or more methods. An alternative solution is to replace the bool with an enumeration.
