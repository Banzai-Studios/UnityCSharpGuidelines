title: Don't suppress compiler warnings using the `new` keyword
severity: 1
---
Compiler warning [CS0114](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0114) is issued when breaking [Polymorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_in_object-oriented_programming), one of the most essential object-orientation principles.
The warning goes away when you add the `new` keyword, but it keeps sub-classes difficult to understand. Consider the following two classes:

	public class Book
	{
		public virtual void Print()
		{
			Console.WriteLine("Printing Book");
		}
	}

	public class PocketBook : Book
	{
		public new void Print()
		{
			Console.WriteLine("Printing PocketBook");
		}
	}

This will cause behavior that you would not normally expect from class hierarchies:

	PocketBook pocketBook = new PocketBook();

	pocketBook.Print(); // Outputs "Printing PocketBook "

	((Book)pocketBook).Print(); // Outputs "Printing Book"

It should not make a difference whether you call `Print()` through a reference to the base class or through the derived class.
