title: Don't change a loop variable inside a `for` loop
severity: 2
---
Updating the loop variable within the loop body is generally considered confusing, even more so if the loop variable is modified in more than one place.

	for (int index = 0; index < 10; ++index)
	{
		if (someCondition)
		{
			index = 11; // Wrong! Use 'break' or 'continue' instead.
		}
	}
