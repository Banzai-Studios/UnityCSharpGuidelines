title: Throw exceptions rather than returning some kind of status value
severity: 2
---
A code base that uses return values to report success or failure tends to have nested if-statements sprinkled all over the code. Quite often, a caller forgets to check the return value anyway. Structured exception handling has been introduced to allow you to throw exceptions and catch or replace them at a higher layer. In most systems it is quite common to throw exceptions whenever an unexpected situation occurs. In Unity it is preferrable to use exceptions only for unexpected paths and not for control flow.
