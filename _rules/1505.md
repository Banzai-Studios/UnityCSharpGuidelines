title: Name assemblies after their contained namespace
severity: 3
---
All DLLs should be named according to the pattern *Company*.*Component*.dll where *Company* refers to your company's name and *Component* contains one or more dot-separated clauses. For example `AvivaSolutions.Web.Controls.dll`.

As an example, consider a group of classes organized under the namespace `AvivaSolutions.Web.Binding` exposed by a certain assembly. According to this guideline, that assembly should be called `AvivaSolutions.Web.Binding.dll`.

**Exception:** If you decide to combine classes from multiple unrelated namespaces into one assembly, consider suffixing the assembly name with `Core`, but do not use that suffix in the namespaces. For instance, `AvivaSolutions.Consulting.Core.dll`.
