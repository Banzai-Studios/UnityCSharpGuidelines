title: Evaluate the result of a LINQ expression before returning it
severity: 1
---
Consider the following code snippet

	public IEnumerable<GoldMember> GetGoldMemberCustomers()
	{
		const decimal GoldMemberThresholdInEuro = 1_000_000;

		var query =
			from customer in db.Customers
			where customer.Balance > GoldMemberThresholdInEuro
			select new GoldMember(customer.Name, customer.Balance);

		return query;
	}

Since LINQ queries use deferred execution, returning `query` will actually return the expression tree representing the above query. Each time the caller evaluates this result using a `foreach` loop or similar, the entire query is re-executed resulting in new instances of `GoldMember` every time. Consequently, you cannot use the `==` operator to compare multiple `GoldMember` instances. Instead, always explicitly evaluate the result of a LINQ query using `ToList()`, `ToArray()` or similar methods.
