title: It should be possible to treat a derived type as if it were a base type
severity: 2
---
In other words, you should be able to pass an instance of a derived class wherever its base class is expected, without the callee knowing the derived class. A very notorious example of a violation of this rule is throwing a `NotImplementedException` when overriding methods from a base class. A less subtle example is not honoring the behavior expected by the base class.

**Note:** This rule is also known as the Liskov Substitution Principle, one of the [S.O.L.I.D.](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/03/07/pablo-s-topic-of-the-month-march-solid-principles.aspx) principles.
