title: Only use the `dynamic` keyword when talking to a dynamic object
severity: 1
---
The `dynamic` keyword has been introduced for interop with languages where properties and methods can appear and disappear at runtime. Using it can introduce a serious performance bottleneck, because various compile-time checks (such as overload resolution) need to happen at runtime, again and again on each invocation. You'll get better performance using cached reflection lookups, `Activator.CreateInstance()` or pre-compiled expressions (see [here](https://andrewlock.net/benchmarking-4-reflection-methods-for-calling-a-constructor-in-dotnet/) for examples and benchmark results).

While using `dynamic` may improve code readability, try to avoid it in library code (especially in hot code paths). However, keep things in perspective: we're talking microseconds here, so perhaps you'll gain more by optimizing your SQL statements first.
